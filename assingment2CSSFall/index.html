                   <p> On a balcony in summer air </p>
                   <p> See the  <span class="chorus">lights</span>, see the<span class="chorus">party</span> , the<span class="chorus">ball gowns</span>  </p>
                   <p>See you make your way through the crowd</p>
                   <p>And say,  <span class="chorus">"Hello"</span> </p>

                    <p>And I was cryin' on the staircase </p>
                    <p>Beggin' you, <span class="chorus">"Please don't go, "</span> and I said </p>
